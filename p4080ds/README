The RCW directories names for the p4080ds board conform to the following naming
convention:

a_bcdef_g:

a = 'R' if RGMII is supported / 'N' if not available/not used

b = What is available in Slot 1
c = What is available in Slot 2
d = What is available in Slot 3
e = What is available in Slot 4
f = What is available in Slot 5

For the Slots (b..f):
 'N' if not available/not used
 'P' if PCIe
 'X' if XAUI
 'R' if SRIO
 'S' if SGMII
 'A' is AURORA

g = 'hex value of serdes protocol value'

So R_PPSXX_0xe means:
 - RGMII is enabled
 - PCIE on Slot 1
 - PCIE on Slot 2
 - SGMII on Slot 3
 - XAUI on Slot 4
 - XAUI on Slot 5

and the SERDES Protocol is 0xe.
