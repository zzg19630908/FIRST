The RCW directories names for the T2080QDS board conforming to the following
naming convention:

ab_cdefgh_k_l:

a = 'R' indicates RGMII1@DTSEC3 is supported
b = 'R' indicates RGMII2@DTSEC4 is supported
    'N' indicates not available/not used

c = What is available in Slot 1
d = What is available in Slot 2
e = What is available in Slot 3
f = What is available in Slot 4
g = What is available in Slot 5
h = What is available between SATA and SRIO

For the Slots (c..h):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'X' is XAUI
 'R' is SRIO
 'S' is SGMII
 'H' is SATA
 'F' is XFI
 'A' is AURORA

For the srds_prtcl (k,l):
k = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'
l = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

So RR_PNNPPH_66_15 means:
 - RGMII1@DTSEC3 on board
 - RGMII2@DTSEC4 on board
 - PCIe4 on Slot 1
 - NULL on Slot 2
 - NULL on Slot 3
 - PCIe1 on Slot 4
 - PCIe2 on Slot 5
 - SATA is available
 - SERDES1 Protocol is 0x66 and SERDES2 Protocol is 0x15.
