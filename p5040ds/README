The RCW directories names for the p5040ds board conform to the following naming
convention:

ab_bcdefghi_j:

a = 'R' if RGMII FM1@DTSEC5 is supported / 'N' if not available/not used
b = 'R' if RGMII FM2@DTSEC5 is supported / 'N" if not available/not used

c = What is available in Slot 1
d = What is available in Slot 2
e = What is available in Slot 3
f = What is available in Slot 4
g = What is available in Slot 5
h = What is available in Slot 6
i = What is available in Slot 7

For the Slots (c..i):
 'N' if not available/not used
 'p' if PCIe x2
 'P' if PCIe x4
 'X' if XAUI
 'R' if SRIO
 'S' if SGMII
 'H' if SATA
 'A' is AURORA

j = 'hex value of serdes protocol value'

So RR_XXSNSpP_0x02 means:
 - RGMII FM1@DTSEC5
 - RGMII FM2@DTSEC5
 - XAUI on Slots 1 and 2
 - PCIE on Slots 6 and 7
 - SGMII on Slots 3 and 5

Slot 4 is not used, and the SERDES Protocol is 0x02.
