abc_def_g (RNSS_NPP_77) nomenclature means:
a = 'R'  indicates RGMII1 @ DTSEC4 is supported
b = 'N'  indicates RGMII2 is not available
c = 'S'  indicates 1G SGMII on-board is supported
d = 'S'  indicates 2.5G SGMII on-board is supported
e = 'N'  indicates PCIe3 in the PCIe slot is not available
f = 'P'  indicates PCIe2 in the 1st mini-PCI
g = 'P'  indicates PCIe1 in the 2nd mini-PCI
h = '77' indicates SerDes protocol 0x77
