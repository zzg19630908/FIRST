The RCW directories names for the LS1021AQDS boards conform to the following
naming convention:


abc_def_gh_i:

a = What is available @eTSEC1
b = What is available @eTSEC2
c = What is available @eTSEC3

For the eTSEC
 'R' indicates RGMII@eTSEC is supported
 'N' if not available/not used

d = What is available in slot1
e = What is available in slot2
f = What is available in slot3

For the Slots:
 'P' if PCIe
 'S' if SGMII

g = 'S' indicates sata0 is supported /
	'N' if not available/not used
h = 'S' indicates sata1 is supported /
	'N' if not available/not used


For the srds_prtcl:
i = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Note: For serdes protocol 0x60, RGMII@EC3,
So NNR_PSS_NN_60 means:
 - RGMII@EC3
 - PCIe*2 on slot 1
 - SGMII1 on slot 2
 - SGMII2 on slot 3
 - SERDES1 Protocol is 0x60

Files naming convention
=============================

rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_specialsetting.rcw
x = Core frequency
bootmode = bootmode:SD/NAND/NOR and so on.
specialsetting = special setting:
			lpuart:used for lpuart
			sben:Secure boot
			sai:Synchronous Audio Interface (SAI) support
			usb2:USB 2.0 support
For example,
	rcw_1000.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz with nor boot.

	rcw_1000_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz with sd boot.

	rcw_1000_lpuart.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz with nor boot special for lpuart.
