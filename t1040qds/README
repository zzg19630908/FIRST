The RCW directories names for the T1040QDS boards conform to the following
naming convention:


ab_cdefghi_j:

a = 'R' if RGMII@MAC4 or RGMII@MAC2 is supported /
	'N' if not available/not used
b = 'R' if RGMII@MAC5 is supported / 'N' if not available/not used

c = What is available in slot1
d = What is available in slot2
e = What is available in slot3
f = What is available in slot4
g = What is available in slot5
h = What is available in slot6
i = What is available in slot7

For the Slots (c):
 'P' if PCIe
 'S' if SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII

For the srds_prtcl (j):
j = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Note: For serdes protocol 0x66, RGMII is avaliable on FM@MAC4 and FM@MAC5
So RR_PPPPQQS_66 means:
 - RGMII@mac4
 - RGMII@mac5
 - PCIe2 on slot 1
 - PCIe1 on slot 2
 - PCIe4 on slot 3
 - PCIe3 on slot 4
 - QSGMII on slot 5,6
 - SGMII on slot 7
 - SATA
 - SERDES1 Protocol is 0x66

Files naming convention
=============================

rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_clockmode.rcw

x = Core frequency
clockmode = single_source for single source clocking.
	    If single_source is not present, it means separate clock sources
	    for sysclk and ddrclk

For example,
	rcw_1000MHz.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz having
	separate clock sources

	rcw_1000MHz_single_source.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz
	having single clock source

5*1G case for CISCO
=============================
Add rcw files for serdes protocol 0x86.
This serdes configuration is only for CISCO T1042QDS/T1022QDS case.
