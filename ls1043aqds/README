The RCW directories names for the LS1043AQDS boards conform to the following
naming convention:

ab_cdef_g:

a = 'R' indicates RGMII1@DTSEC3 is supported
b = 'R' indicates RGMII2@DTSEC4 is supported
    'N' indicates not available/not used

c = What is available in Slot 1 or SPF cage
d = What is available in Slot 2
e = What is available in Slot 3
f = What is available in Slot 4

For the Slots (c..f):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'X' is XAUI
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA
 'A' is AURORA

For the srds_prtcl (g):
g = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

So RR_FQPP_1455 means:
 - RGMII1@DTSEC3 on board
 - RGMII2@DTSEC4 on board
 - XFI on SFP cage
 - QSGMII on Slot 2
 - PCIe2 on Slot 3
 - PCIe3 on Slot 4
 - SERDES1 Protocol is 0x1455

BIN   Core/Platform/FMan/DDR
Bin1: 1500MHz/400MHz/500MHz/1600MT/s
Bin2: 1400MHz/300MHz/500MHz/1600MT/s
Bin3: 1200MHz/300MHz/500MHz/1300MT/s

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_specialsetting.rcw
x = Core frequency
bootmode = bootmode:SD/NAND/NOR and so on.
specialsetting = special setting:
			lpuart:used for lpuart
			sben:Secure boot
For example,
	rcw_1600.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1600MHz with nor boot.

	rcw_1600_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1600MHz with sd boot.

	rcw_1600_lpuart.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1600MHz with nor boot special for lpuart.
