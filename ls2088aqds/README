The RCW directories names for the LS2088AQDS boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefgh_ijklmn_op_qr:

a = What is available in SFP cage 1
b = What is available in SFP cage 2
c = What is available in SFP cage 3
d = What is available in SFP cage 4
e = What is available in SFP cage 5
f = What is available in SFP cage 6
g = What is available in SFP cage 7
h = What is available in SFP cage 8
i = What is available in Slot 1
j = What is available in Slot 2
k = What is available in Slot 3
l = What is available in Slot 4
m = What is available in Slot 5
n = What is available in Slot 6
o = SATA1
p = SATA2

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA

Serdes1 protocol (q):
q = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (r):
r = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR/DP-DDR
Bin1: 2000MHz/800MHz/2133MT/s/1600MT/s


Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_bootmode.rcw

x = Core frequency
bootmode = nor(default)/sd/qspi

For example,
  rcw_2000.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz with nor boot.
  rcw_2000_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz with SD boot.
