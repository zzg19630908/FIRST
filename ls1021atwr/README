The RCW directories names for the LS1021ATWR boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abc_def_g:

a = What is available in eTSEC1
b = What is available in eTSEC2
c = What is available in eTSEC3

For the eTSECn
 'R' indicates RGMII@eTSECn is supported /
 'S' indicates SGMII@eTSECn is supported
	'N' if not available/not used

d = 'P' indicates PCIe@slot1 is supported /
	'N' if not available/not used
e = 'P' indicates PCIe@slot2 is supported /
	'N' if not available/not used
f = 'S' indicates sata is supported /
	'N' if not available/not used

For the srds_prtcl:
g = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Note: For serdes protocol 0x30, RGMII@EC3,
So SSR_PNS_30 means:
 - SGMII@EC1
 - SGMII@EC2
 - RGMII@EC3
 - PCIe*1 on slot 1
 - SATA
 - SERDES1 Protocol is 0x30

Files naming convention
=============================

rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_specialsetting.rcw
x = Core frequency
bootmode = bootmode:SD/NAND/NOR and so on.
specialsetting = special setting:
			lpuart:used for lpuart
			sben:Secure boot
			dcu:2D-ACE support
For example,
	rcw_1000.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz with nor boot.

	rcw_1000_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz with sd boot.

	rcw_1000_lpuart.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1000MHz with nor boot special for lpuart.
