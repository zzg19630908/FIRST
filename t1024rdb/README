The RCW directories names for the T1024RDB board
conforming to the following naming convention:

abc_def_g (RRX_PPP_95) nomenclature means:
a = 'R'  indicates RGMII1 @ DTSEC4 is supported
b = 'R'  indicates RGMII2 @ DTSEC3 is supported
c = 'X'  indicates 10G Base-T is supported
d = 'P'  indicates PCIe3 in the PCIe slot
e = 'P'  indicates PCIe2 in the 1st mini-PCI
f = 'P'  indicates PCIe1 in the 2nd mini-PCI
g = '95' indicates SerDes protocol 0x95


abc_def_g (RNS_NPP_135) nomenclature means:
a = 'R'  indicates RGMII1 @ DTSEC4 is supported
b = 'N'  indicates RGMII2 is not available
c = 'S'  indicates 2.5G SGMII on-board is supported
d = 'N'  indicates PCIe3 in the PCIe slot is not available
e = 'P'  indicates PCIe2 in the 1st mini-PCI
f = 'P'  indicates PCIe1 in the 2nd mini-PCI
g = '135' indicates SerDes protocol 0x135

Default Core/DDR/Platform/FMan = 1400MHz/1600MT/s/400MHz/700MHz
User can change the default RCW configuraton for different frequency.
