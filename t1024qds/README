The RCW directories names for the T1024QDS board conforming to
the following naming convention:

ab_cdefg_h:

a = 'R' indicates RGMII1@DTSEC3 is supported
b = 'R' indicates RGMII2@DTSEC4 is supported
    'N' indicates not available/not used

c = What is available in Slot 1
d = What is available in Slot 2
e = What is available in Slot 3
f = What is available in Slot 4
g = What is available in Slot 5

For the Slots (c..g):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'X' is XFI
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' is QSGMII
 'H' is SATA
 'A' is AURORA

For the srds_prtcl (h):
h = 'hex value of serdes protocol value'

So NR_NPSSS_6F  means:
 - RGMII1@DTSEC3 not available
 - RGMII2@DTSEC4 on board
 - NULL  on Slot 1
 - PCIe1 on Slot 2
 - SGMII on Slot 3
 - SGMII on Slot 4
 - SGMII on Slot 5
 - SERDES Protocol is 0x6F.
