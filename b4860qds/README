The RCW directories names for the B4860QDS board conform to the following naming
convention:

a_bcde_f_g:

a = 'R' if RGMII is supported / 'N' if not available/not supported

b = What is available in Slot 1 of AMC
c = What is available in Slot 2 of AMC
d = 'S' if RGMII is there on phy1 of dual SGMII phy VSC8662 / 'N' if not available /not used
e = 'S' if RGMII is there on phy2 of dual SGMII phy VSC8662 / 'N' if not available /not used

For the Slots (b and c):
 'N' if not available/not used
 'P' if PCIe
 'X' if XAUI
 'R' if SRIO
 'S' if SGMII
 'A' is AURORA

f = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'
g = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

So N_PNSS_0x9_0xa means:
 - RGMII is unsupported
 - PCIE on Slot 1
 - Nothing on Slot 2
 - SGMII on phy1
 - SGMII on phy2

SERDES1 Protocol is 0x9 and the SERDES2 Protocol is 0xa.
